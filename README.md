The project begins by setting up the necessary libraries and tools, including PyTorch, OpenCV, and the YOLOv5 model repository. A pre-trained YOLOv5 model is loaded to detect text in images. Additionally, EasyOCR is used to extract text regions from images. The process involves reading images from a specified folder, detecting text boxes using EasyOCR, and then normalizing these coordinates to prepare annotations in the YOLO format. These annotations are saved in text files alongside the corresponding images.

Next, the YOLOv5 model is trained using the annotated images to enhance its ability to detect text. The model is evaluated to assess its performance, and then exported to various formats like ONNX, TensorRT, and CoreML for deployment on different platforms.

This approach leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision to efficiently recognize and locate text within images, making it a valuable tool for various applications.
